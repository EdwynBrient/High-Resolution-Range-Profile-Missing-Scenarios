# High-Resolution-Range-Profile-Missing-Scenarios

This repository will host a subset of radar and generated data used in our research on conditional generation of High-Resolution Range Profiles (HRRP) for maritime targets. 

**This repository is currently under preparation. Data will be released soon.**

## Overview

High-Resolution Range Profiles (HRRPs) are 1D radar signatures widely used for radar-based target recognition. Due to the limited availability of labeled radar data, we propose generative models (GANs, DDPMs) conditioned on physical attributes (e.g., ship dimensions, viewing angle) to synthesize realistic HRRP signals.

The dataset to be released will include:
- Selected real HRRP examples from our measurement campaign  
- Synthetic HRRPs generated using our conditional models

**License:** To be defined. Intended for academic use only.
